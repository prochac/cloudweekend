Hey there,

As your entry task, we'd like you to provide us with a built and working Docker image.

You can share your code with us via repo. BONUS: multiple logical commits are preferable to just one.

*Requirements*

- A simple html site, with the title "I want to attend the Kiwi.com Weekend in the Cloud"

 - A simple site will be enough, but feel free to get creative.

- Use Nginx as your web server

 - BONUS: use SSL

  - Hint: use Let's Encrypt

    - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/

- Use Docker Hub to build and share your image



Please send an email to cloudweekend@kiwi.com with a link to your repo by May 10. Good solutions received earlier will be accepted right away.



Regards,

Jan Bleha
